surveyed the entire sky in four broad near-infrared and mid-infrared 
bandpasses, including W3 = 12&mu;m. Raw W3 imaging contains a 
wealth of information about the small-angular-scale emission from polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons in the interstellar medium. However, there are also many 
<a href="before_after.html">contaminants</a>. We have isolated the W3 cirrus 
by PSF subtracting pointlike sources, correcting bright source artifacts, 
masking resolved galaxies and moving Solar system objects, and eliminating 
time-dependent artifacts, among other processing steps. Much of this 
custom processing was performed at the single-exposure "L1b" level. We stacked 
our custom-processed L1b exposures on the footprints of  430 
12.5&deg;&times;12.5&deg; "WSSA" tiles to produce a full-sky map. 
<i>Importantly, this map has been smoothed to 15'' from the native 6'' W3 
resolution</i>. The zero-point on scales larger than 2&deg; is derived from 
<a href="http://www.sciops.esa.int/wikiSI/planckpla/index.php">Planck</a> 
350&mu;m. The WSSA tiles each have several extensions, including bit-masks. 
Table 2 and Table 3 of the <a href="ms.pdf">paper</a> provide mask bit and 
extension descriptions  and are reproduced in the 
<a href="README">README</a>.
